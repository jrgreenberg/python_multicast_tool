# python_multicast_tool
So a little background... I was troubleshooting an issue with multicast for an Informcast deployment. IC has their own multicast test tool, but it only works for Windows PCs. I thought to myself that there has be a way to test multicast with any OS easily and I did some googline to find some solutions. I found this great article from pymotw, referenece below, and thought that this might be my answer. When I tried to run the python application, I got some failures. It looks like the code was written for python 2.X, which is not very common anymore. I found where the code needed to be fixed and made a few other minor modifications and got it working. It's a small program and I could probably clean it up a little bit, which I might in the future. I figured I would share it out for anybody who might need something like this. 

This is a Multicast tool for sending and receiving multicast on a network. This is not my code, but I retrofitted for python 3. Credit to Doug Hellman. Original code link https://pymotw.com/2/socket/multicast.html
